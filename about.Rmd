description: |
  Hello and welcome to the course blog for Text-as-Data (POLSCI 797TA; DACSS 697D). In this course, students learn the fundamentals of text-as-data research, with an introduction to the field and broader theoretical considerations followed by an exploration of a host of different methodological approaches and applications using text-as-data. The focus is on exploration, with students — motivated by central research questions — exploring the opportunities, challenges, and limitations of different approaches. 
  
   In this space, students will chronicle their exploration. The goal is not to report results of weekly analyses but rather to discuss the voyage. Posts will track students from considering their broader research project and interests through to the completion of a poster presentation. What’s working or not working? What new concerns or problems are cropping up? What interesting avenues for future exploration are opening up? Posts detailing the crushing realization that a giant and painstakingly-curated corpus is limited in addressing the student’s research question is equally appropriate to a post detailing interesting results or a post that details the variety of obscene errors the researcher made trying to implement some analysis. 
   
   In all, we’ll use this space to reflect on the journey, not report where we are. So welcome to our community! Off we go…
